# QuestionWiz

The motivation behind this project was to help me prepare for software engineering job interviews while also keeping my skills fresh & doing something fun. This project was built to help me study and learn, creating my own application & quizzes..This application will help the user study in a fun and interactive manner.During this project I learned alot about the user authentication process, JWT, HTTP codes, and browswer caching.

## Project Description
User will be prompted to either sign in or log in. User can then choose a category to get quizzed in.. 20 questions will be chosen randomly and displayed. After the user has completed the quiz, the results/score and correct answers will be shown. Then the user will save their results and go to the leader board to see where they stand against other Quiz Wiz Champions.
